# weather-icons

This is a project solely for icons of a weather app. I have also used Bootstrap and Font Awesome icons to make the task easier for me. The icons I made here can be used anywhere in your project. 

    -- For that you can just paste the style.css in your environment and link it where you wanna use the icons.

    -- For using different icons, you gotta search for that icon name which I have commented in the beginning of every icon. Just copy everything below that commented name, such that: 

        <div class="icon fa-cloudy p-relative">
          <div class="text-transparent cloud cloud_xlg"><i class="fa-solid fa-cloud"></i></div>
          <div class="text-transparent cloud cloud_sm at_back"><i class="fa-solid fa-cloud"></i></div>
        </div>

        # this is the code for "Partyl Cloudy" Icon

    -- You can also modify the design by tweaking the style.css file
